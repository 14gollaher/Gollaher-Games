<h1>
Web application for Gollaher Games. 
</h1>


The vision for this project isn't a site to visit where users wish to play games, but instead see information about some of my favorite games! The first iteration of this site will be showing information for Super Smash Bros 4 for WiiU. 

Technologies used: C#, MVC, ASP.NET Core, HTML 5, Bootstrap 4, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Typescript, and Knockout.
